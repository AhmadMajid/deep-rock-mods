A Mod Manager. Miracle line mods only.<br></em></strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><strong>MIRACLE MOD MANAGER</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Miners, R&amp;D is particularly proud of this one, though I am not too sure why, since they don't actually have anything to do with it.</em></p>\n<p><em>After the recent events in regards with some intrusions into our territory, management has decided to team up with another company. Now, I personally don't know much about the deal and I personally don't like the idea of other companies being involved, but I was assured that the tech we are getting is worth it.<br></em></p>\n<p><em>As far as I have been made aware, the systems that have been installed on the Space Rig shouldn't affect you too much, even though there is a new terminal right next to the Drop Pod access ramp. There is a large amount of addons though, which we might be getting access to at some point.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This mod, at least by itself, does not actually do that much. However it does provide a framework for all mods of the Miracle line. It also provides a central place for these mods to provide a settings menu and more importantly share some common functions.</p>\n<p>To access the settings head over to one of the new terminals present on the Space Rig. There are three terminals by default located in the hosts cabin, the medbay and next to the droppod's access ramp. You can configure which of these you would want to use from the settings menu. Should you, by accident, disable all three terminals, the one next to the droppod's access ramp will automagically reappear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>HOW DO I TELL A MOD NEEDS THIS?<br></strong></p>\n<p>It's quite simple really. All mods that require the Miracle Mod Manager will have the Miracle logo somewhere on their banner. In most cases the Miracle Mod Manager will also be listed as a requirement so that you definitely know that it is indeed needed. Alternative take a look at the list below to see which mods are currently in need of this Mod Manager.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>WHY THE MIRACLE MOD MANAGER AND NOT ModHub / DRGLib / WHATEVER IS OUT THERE?</strong></p>\n<p>Quite simple honestly: I wan't to be able to make my mods the way I want to and not rely on the works of others. This way if I need to change something or need something added, I can just do so whenever. It also allows me to decide <em>how </em>I want these features implemented and what workarounds I'm fine with. If I were to use a premade framework I would be bound to its quirks and bugs and honestly... I don't feel like conforming to that. If you don't like it the solution is quite simple: Don't use it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CAN THE SETTINGS BE CHANGED IN A MISSION?</strong></p>\n<p>Simply said: No. Any settings for any of the supported mods can only be changed at the terminals located on the Space Rig.<br>Mods that require the Miracle Mod Manager are set up in such a way that they will only load their settings once when starting a new mission.<br>In other words: <em>Your choices have consequences for at least the next mission</em>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS MOD MANAGER ACTUALLY DO THEN?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>NEW TERMINALS</strong></p>\n<p>This mod can add up to 4 new terminals, although only 2 of them are always active. These terminals can be split into two typs:<br>Settings terminals - These terminals provide access to the Mod Managers main menu, primarily the settings added by other mods of the Miracle line. The settings terminals can be found</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the hosts cabin. <em>This terminal will always be present</em></li>\n<li>Next to the DropPod access ramp</li>\n<li>Near the exit of the MedBay</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contracts terminal - This terminal provides access to the Contracts system. Basically a custom version of assignments. The Miracle Mod Manager comes bundled with a few basic contracts. The main intention however is for other mods to add their own contracts at a later date. The contracts terminal can be found</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the Abyss Bar. <em>This terminal will always be present</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>CONTRACTS</strong></p>\n<p>Contracts behave very similar to the assignments you know from the base game. Each contract will have a certain amount of tasks to be completed during normal gameplay.<br>Contracts can be started and aborted at the Contracts terminal at the Abyss Bar.<br><em>The contracts bundled with the Miracle Mod Manager will have no direct impact on normal gameplay and are entirely optional.<br>Contracts were added with version 2.0.0</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>THE SHOP</strong></p>\n<p>The shop allows you to spend some of your hard earned minerals and credits on shiny MiraCoin. This new currency will be used in other Miracle line mods for various purposes. The most common one being to allow the mod in question to stay approved. MiraCoin come in a variety of bundles, each with their own percentage of cost reduction.<em><br>The Shop and MiraCoin are intended to be used with other Miracle line mods. It will show a warning when none of the mods you have installed make use of it. Any MiraCoin bought can not be refunded.<br>The Shop was added with verison 2.0.0</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>ACHIEVEMENTS</strong></p>\n<p>Similarly to the base game the Miracle Mod Manager and most of the other Miracle line mods come with their own achievements. These are rewarded for various actions when playing with any Miracle line mod and don't server any particular purpose apart from giving you a pleasant surpise whenever you unlock one. Ideas for more achievements are always welcome!<br><em>Achievements were added during S01</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>EXTRAS</strong></p>\n<p>Have you ever had to type in one of those long codes to activate a game on steam?

A Mod Manager. Miracle line mods only.\n\n \n\nMIRACLE MOD MANAGER\n\nMiners, R&D is particularly proud of this one, though I am not too sure why, since they don't actually have anything to do with it.\n\nAfter the recent events in regards with some intrusions into our territory, management has decided to team up with another company. Now, I personally don't know much about the deal and I personally don't like the idea of other companies being involved, but I was assured that the tech we are getting is worth it.\n\nAs far as I have been made aware, the systems that have been installed on the Space Rig shouldn't affect you too much, even though there is a new terminal right next to the Drop Pod access ramp. There is a large amount of addons though, which we might be getting access to at some point.\n\n \n\nThis mod, at least by itself, does not actually do that much. However it does provide a framework for all mods of the Miracle line. It also provides a central place for these mods to provide a settings menu and more importantly share some common functions.\n\nTo access the settings head over to one of the new terminals present on the Space Rig. There are three terminals by default located in the hosts cabin, the medbay and next to the droppod's access ramp. You can configure which of these you would want to use from the settings menu. Should you, by accident, disable all three terminals, the one next to the droppod's access ramp will automagically reappear.\n\n \n\nHOW DO I TELL A MOD NEEDS THIS?\n\nIt's quite simple really. All mods that require the Miracle Mod Manager will have the Miracle logo somewhere on their banner. In most cases the Miracle Mod Manager will also be listed as a requirement so that you definitely know that it is indeed needed. Alternative take a look at the list below to see which mods are currently in need of this Mod Manager.\n\n \n\nWHY THE MIRACLE MOD MANAGER AND NOT MODHUB / DRGLIB / WHATEVER IS OUT THERE?\n\nQuite simple honestly: I wan't to be able to make my mods the way I want to and not rely on the works of others. This way if I need to change something or need something added, I can just do so whenever. It also allows me to decide how I want these features implemented and what workarounds I'm fine with. If I were to use a premade framework I would be bound to its quirks and bugs and honestly... I don't feel like conforming to that. If you don't like it the solution is quite simple: Don't use it.\n\n \n\nCAN THE SETTINGS BE CHANGED IN A MISSION?\n\nSimply said: No. Any settings for any of the supported mods can only be changed at the terminals located on the Space Rig.\nMods that require the Miracle Mod Manager are set up in such a way that they will only load their settings once when starting a new mission.\nIn other words: Your choices have consequences for at least the next mission.\n\n \n\nWHAT DOES THIS MOD MANAGER ACTUALLY DO THEN?\n\nNEW TERMINALS\n\nThis mod can add up to 4 new terminals, although only 2 of them are always active. These terminals can be split into two typs:\nSettings terminals - These terminals provide access to the Mod Managers main menu, primarily the settings added by other mods of the Miracle line. The settings terminals can be found\n\n \t* In the hosts cabin. This terminal will always be present\n \t* Next to the DropPod access ramp\n \t* Near the exit of the MedBay\n\nContracts terminal - This terminal provides access to the Contracts system. Basically a custom version of assignments. The Miracle Mod Manager comes bundled with a few basic contracts. The main intention however is for other mods to add their own contracts at a later date. The contracts terminal can be found\n\n \t* At the Abyss Bar. This terminal will always be present\n\n \n\nCONTRACTS\n\nContracts behave very similar to the assignments you know from the base game. Each contract will have a certain amount of tasks to be completed during normal gameplay.\nContracts can be started and aborted at the Contracts terminal at the Abyss Bar.\nThe contracts bundled with the Miracle Mod Manager will have no direct impact on normal gameplay and are entirely optional.\nContracts were added with version 2.0.0\n\n \n\nTHE SHOP\n\nThe shop allows you to spend some of your hard earned minerals and credits on shiny MiraCoin. This new currency will be used in other Miracle line mods for various purposes. The most common one being to allow the mod in question to stay approved. MiraCoin come in a variety of bundles, each with their own percentage of cost reduction.\nThe Shop and MiraCoin are intended to be used with other Miracle line mods. It will show a warning when none of the mods you have installed make use of it. Any MiraCoin bought can not be refunded.\nThe Shop was added with verison 2.0.0\n\n \n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\nSimilarly to the base game the Miracle Mod Manager and most of the other Miracle line mods come with their own achievements. These are rewarded for various actions when playing with any Miracle line mod and don't server any particular purpose apart from giving you a pleasant surpise whenever you unlock one. Ideas for more achievements are always welcome!\nAchievements were added during S01\n\n \n\nEXTRAS\n\nHave you ever had to type in one of those long codes to activate a game on steam? This is basically the same thing, except it doesn't unlock any games. This is intended to allow access to advanced settings, beta versions or other things that would otherwise clutter the main settings pages of a mod. As an example look at \"Faulty Terrain Scanner\" where most of the settings are hidden unless you enable the extended settings extra\nExtras were added during S01\n\n \n\n \n\nSUPPORTED MODS\n\nThese mods were made with the Miracle Mod Manager in mind and either are supported by it or require it to function:\n\n \t* Assignment Reroll\n \t* Buyable Missions\n \t* Camera Mode [Beta]\n \t* Custom Killfeed\n \t* Custom Soundtrack\n \t* Dreadful Ending\n \t* Faulty Terrain Scanner\n \t* Miracle's Magnificent M.U.L.E.s\n \t* Miracle's Mandatory Secondaries\n \t* Miracle's Mission Requester\n \t* Miracle's More Mutators\n \t* Pettable Maggots\n\n \n\nHOW DO I REPORT A BUG? CAN I ASK QUESTIONS ANYWHERE?\n\nTo report a bug simply write a comment on the page of the mod you found the bug for. Chances are that you'll get a response within a day or two.\nBugs reported through the community modding discord however will almost certainly go without answer.\n\n \n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n\n \t* None\n\n \n\nSandbox icon can be found here\nStar icon can be found here\n","id":1582325,"logo":{"filename":"banner.png","original":"https://image.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/banner.png","thumb_1280x720":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_1280x720/banner.png","thumb_320x180":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_320x180/banner.png","thumb_640x360":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_640x360/banner.png"},"maturity_option":0,"media":{"images":[{"filename":"banner.1.png","original":"https://image.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/banner.1.png","thumb_1280x720":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_1280x720/banner.1.png","thumb_320x180":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_320x180/banner.1.png"},{"filename":"terminalv2.jpg","original":"https://image.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/terminalv2.jpg","thumb_1280x720":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_1280x720/terminalv2.jpg","thumb_320x180":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_320x180/terminalv2.jpg"},{"filename":"terminal_droppod.jpg","original":"https://image.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/terminal_droppod.jpg","thumb_1280x720":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_1280x720/terminal_droppod.jpg","thumb_320x180":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_320x180/terminal_droppod.jpg"},{"filename":"terminal_medbay.jpg","original":"https://image.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/terminal_medbay.jpg","thumb_1280x720":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_1280x720/terminal_medbay.jpg","thumb_320x180":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_320x180/terminal_medbay.jpg"},{"filename":"terminal_contracts.jpg","original":"https://image.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/terminal_contracts.jpg","thumb_1280x720":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_1280x720/terminal_contracts.jpg","thumb_320x180":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/mods/9cc5/1582325/crop_320x180/terminal_contracts.jpg"}],"sketchfab":[],"youtube":[]},"metadata_blob":"","metadata_kvp":[],"modfile":{"changelog":"[o]\n| -&gt; (ConVar) Fixed an issue that would cause some string printed to the console to be discarded\n| -&gt; (Contracts) Fixed some materials being missing on the contracts terminal\n| -&gt; Fixed Droppod and Medbay toggle not actually working\n| -&gt; Fixed settings not saving correctly","date_added":1692041381,"download":{"binary_url":"https://g-2475.modapi.io/v1/games/2475/mods/1582325/files/4172933/download/cd538ccfaa619036c5172072510a26a7","date_expires":1713011513},"filename":"miraclemodmanager_u38_2.1.3-8bxg.zip","filesize":11713564,"id":4172933,"metadata_blob":"","mod_id":1582325,"version":"U38_2.1.3","virus_positive":0,"virus_status":1},"name":"Miracle Mod Manager","profile_url":"https://mod.io/g/drg/m/miracle-mod-manager","stats":{"downloads_total":435865,"popularity_rank_position":23,"popularity_rank_total_mods":4802,"ratings_display_text":"Very Positive","ratings_negative":42,"ratings_percentage_positive":91,"ratings_positive":437,"ratings_total":479,"ratings_weighted_aggregate":0.88,"subscribers_total":74517},"status":1,"submitted_by":{"avatar":{"filename":"0510aa4ea058bc7fcf1533b3f1a7dbc.jpg","original":"https://image.modcdn.io/members/dc26/6475726/0510aa4ea058bc7fcf1533b3f1a7dbc.jpg","thumb_100x100":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/members/dc26/6475726/crop_100x100/0510aa4ea058bc7fcf1533b3f1a7dbc.jpg","thumb_50x50":"https://thumb.modcdn.io/members/dc26/6475726/crop_50x50/0510aa4ea058bc7fcf1533b3f1a7dbc.jpg"},"date_online":0,"id":6475726,"profile_url":"https://mod.io/u/miracoulon","username":"Miracoulon"},"summary":"A manager for the Miracle line of (maybe) high quality mods.

This is due solely to the EPC's fire-on-release mechanic not working properly without it. TBD: make that delay EPC specific, to reduce the not-firing to sprinting delay (dramatically).</del> Implemented in 1.1.0</p>\n<p><del>* Lok1 should delay sprint while firing according to how many lock-ons are acquired. Currently, Lok1 delays sprinting after fire release based on the maximum fire duration.</del> Implemented in 1.1.3<br><br>* Implement some fix for Second Wind so that this mod can work properly with it.</p>\n<p><br>Bugs:<br>* <del>Dash cannot be activated. Potential workaround: use <a href=\"https://mod.io/g/drg/m/simpleqol\">Simple QOL mod</a> to set sprint to an alternate key and bind dash to your original sprint button (credit <a href=\"https://mod.io/u/handdrawnnerd\" title=\"mention:members:handdrawnnerd:6437543\">HandDrawnNerd</a>)</del> Fixed in 1.1.1</p>\n<p><del>* Lok1 cannot burst shot while moving forward.</del> Fixed in 1.1.2</p>\n<p><del>* M1000 with Hipster does not fire correctly.</del> Fixed in 1.1.2</p>\n<p><del>* Sometimes other players observe you as running in place when stationary lol. (Not sure if I'll fix, since it seems as though I would need to force everyone in a game to have this mod =(. If I can figure out another way, I'll take a stab at it.) </del> Fixed(?) in 1.1.7?

No clue how to fix yet =(. </del> \"Fixed\" in 1.1.7. Second wind perk now disables this mod to avoid this behavior.</p>\n<p><del>* Issues with many weapons if rapidly pressing fire, releasing, then holding fire again.
